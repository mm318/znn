GENERAL BRAIN BIG PICTURE:

neuron (grid cell) firing frequency plotted in phase space forms a manifold
  - after principal component analysis, manifold was found to be the surface of a torus
  - continuous attractor network
brain is critical point or phase transition point, a neuron on average triggers one other neuron
  - branching ratio (sum of probability of downstream neurons firing should be 1)
overall beat frequency of the neurons (brain waves)
  - theta 4-12 Hz (saving memory)
  - alpha 8-12 Hz
  - delta 1-3 Hz
  - gamma 30-80 Hz
neurons fire from 1 hz (most common) to 10 hz (least common), the rate is logarithmically distributed
  - fast firing is theorized to be generalized knowledge and slow firing is theorized to be specialized knowledge


ARTIFICIAL IMPLEMENTATIONS OF ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY:

- hopfield network
- boltzmann machines
- dense associative memory


ARTIFICIAL IMPLEMENTATIONS OF PREDICTORS:
- tolman-eichenbaum machine (based on hippocampus)
  - graph of knowledge
  - latent space
  - if using softmax, it is mathematically equivalent to tranformers
- hierarchical temporal memory (based on neocortex and pyramidal neurons)


NEURON HIGH-LEVEL GROUP (REGION) STRUCTURE:

hierarchy of cortical columns (high detail & narrow field of view vs low detail & wide field of view)
  - similar to what convolutional neuron network tries to do?
cortical columns (or hypercolumns) have about 50 to 100 minicolumns
minicolumns have about 80 to 140 neurons
minicolumns have layers
  - pyramidal neuron (L2/L3)
    feature (pooling)
  - stellate neuron (L4)
    sensation at orientation (seq mem)
  - regular spiking neuron (L5a)
    object (pooling)
  - intrinsically bursting neuron (L5b)
    feature at location (seq mem)
  - corticothalmic neuron (L6a)
    orientation (motor updated, like head direction cell)
  - corticocortical neuron (L6)
    location (motor updated, like grid cell)
layers communicate with each other using sparse distributed representation


NEURON LOW-LEVEL DETAILS:

neurons have proximal, distal, and apical inputs, determines whether neuron is active or predictive
  - proximal is feedforward, drive input
  - distal is modulatory input, affect how to respond to proximal
  - apical?
  - basal?
each neuron is like a deep neural network
  - temporal order of stimulation along the dendrite impacts resulting input to neuron soma
  - linearly non-separable activation function (xor-like)
    - there is an upper limit to the input that triggers an output
